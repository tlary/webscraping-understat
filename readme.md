This repository contains the code for a Web Scraping project to extract the soccer metrics expected goals (xG) and expected goals against (xGA) from understat.com as well as additional match statistics. The code works for all listed leagues and seasons.

A blogpost describing this project can be found on my [blog](https://tlary.github.io/post/footyscrapes/).
